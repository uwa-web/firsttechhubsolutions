I couldn't sleep all through last night, I was going through all the classes I have missed from the goggle workspace session and Mehn!
From the simplicity to the practicality everything was supero!
I thought I was familiar with goggle tools but I wasn't.
I was truly impressed. It is worth every penny and time"</p>

                <p>I thought I knew everything about Google Workspace—after all, I just finished 8 weeks of virtual assistant training. But when I joined Success Agbeyegbe’s 4-week Google Workspace course, I realized I’d only scratched the surface. We’ve only had two sessions, and I’m already seeing how much more there is to learn. This morning, I found myself practicing what she taught using Google Docs—and smiling while at it. I love getting real value for my money. If you haven’t enrolled yet, don’t miss the next batch. It’s an eye-opener!</p>
